# Understanding the Journey of an HTTPS Request: What Happens When You Visit a Website
========================================================

Hey there, curious minds! Today, let's take an exciting adventure into the world of the internet and discover what happens when you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and press Enter.

## 1. **DNS Request**

The journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) request. The URL "www.google.com" is a human-readable address, but computers communicate using IP addresses. The DNS server translates this human-readable URL into an IP address, like 172.217.169.68, allowing your browser to find the correct server on the internet.

## 2. **TCP/IP**

With the IP address obtained from the DNS server, a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection is established between your computer and Google's server. TCP is a protocol that ensures a reliable and error-free connection between the client and the server.

## 3. **Firewall**

At this stage, the request might pass through a firewallâ€”a security mechanism that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. It acts as a barrier between your network and potential threats from the internet, making sure everything is safe and secure.

## 4. **HTTPS/SSL**

The website you're trying to reach (Google, in this case) likely uses HTTPS, a secure version of HTTP. HTTPS employs Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols to encrypt the data transmitted between your browser and the web server. This encryption ensures the privacy and integrity of the data exchanged.

## 5. **Load-balancer**

High-traffic websites often use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. Load balancers enhance the website's performance, scalability, and availability by preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

## 6. **Web Server**

After passing through the load balancer, the request reaches a web server. The web server processes the request and generates an appropriate response, usually an HTML document along with other resources like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

## 7. **Application Server**

In many cases, the web server communicates with an application server. The application server handles the business logic of the web application. It might interact with databases, perform complex calculations, or execute other processes necessary for the application's functionality.

## 8. **Database**

If the application server needs data from a database, a connection is established to retrieve the required information. The database stores and organizes vast amounts of data that applications utilize to generate dynamic content.

By the time all these steps are completed, the requested webpage's content is gathered, processed, and sent back through the same route. Your browser then displays the webpage, allowing you to interact with it seamlessly.

In conclusion, the simple act of typing a URL and pressing Enter triggers a remarkably intricate sequence of events involving various technologies, protocols, and infrastructure, all working together harmoniously to deliver the web content you desire. Understanding this process can deepen our appreciation of the immense infrastructure that underpins our internet experience.
